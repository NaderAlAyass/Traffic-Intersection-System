# This project was a simple traffic system implemented using a PIC18F4620 baed Microcontroller
# In this traffic system there is a screen that is initialized and used to show the traffic lights in all 4 directions (North,East,South,West)
# It also showcases when the pedestrians can walk and in which direction; It makes a beeping noise when it's in action.
# There is also a day mode and night mode, measured by a photoresistor. 
# Day mode has pedestrian walking abilities, and Night mode doesn't. 

# This project was a good foundation in understanding how embedded c works.
# It's not shown here, but there was a schematic created to connect everything to the Microcontroller
